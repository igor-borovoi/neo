neo-zig is a Zig port of the original neo C++ program. It uses the ncurses
library to control the terminal and is built using the Zig build system.

## Code Structure

The code is split into several files:

- main.zig - Handles the main loop, command-line options, and ncurses setup
- cloud.zig - Implements the Cloud struct, which manages all the Droplets
- droplet.zig - Droplet struct definition (embedded in cloud.zig)
- types.zig - Type definitions, enums, and constants

## Architecture

The application's main loop creates a single Cloud object that manages all
the Droplets. Each Droplet is responsible for moving and drawing a vertical
string of characters.

Cloud keeps track of:
- All active/inactive droplets
- Color and glitch status for each screen position
- Character pool for random character selection
- Column statistics for spawn control

## Pool Pattern

neo-zig uses the "pool" pattern common in game development. Rather than
allocating objects on the fly, it pre-allocates many objects and reuses
them as needed:

- Droplet pool: ~2x the number of columns
- Character pool: 2048 pre-generated characters
- Glitch pool: 1024 positions for glitch effects

## Performance Optimizations

The main optimization is minimizing character draws per frame. Each Droplet
tracks:
- `head_cur_line` / `head_put_line` - Last drawn vs. needs drawing
- `tail_cur_line` / `tail_put_line` - Same for the tail

Only changed positions are redrawn each frame.
