# Installing neo-zig

neo-zig works on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems such as macOS
and FreeBSD. Native Windows is not supported, but neo-zig may work with WSL.

## Prerequisites

1. **Zig compiler** (version 0.11.0 or later)
   - Download from https://ziglang.org/download/
   - Or install via package manager:
     - Arch Linux: `pacman -S zig`
     - macOS: `brew install zig`

2. **ncurses development library**
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libncurses-dev`
   - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S ncurses`
   - Fedora: `sudo dnf install ncurses-devel`
   - macOS: `brew install ncurses`

3. **UTF-8 locale** (for Unicode character sets)
   - Check with: `echo $LANG`
   - Should contain "UTF-8" (e.g., "en_US.UTF-8")

## Building

```bash
cd neo-zig
zig build
```

The executable will be built at `./zig-out/bin/neo-zig`.

## Installing system-wide (optional)

```bash
sudo cp ./zig-out/bin/neo-zig /usr/local/bin/neo-zig
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/neo-zig
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with ncurses errors

Make sure ncurses development headers are installed.

### Unicode characters don't display correctly

1. Ensure your locale is UTF-8: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
2. Use a terminal and font that supports the character set
3. Recommended fonts: Noto Sans Mono, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code
